2. Predicate.or() – Logical OR example

In given example, we have used Predicate.or() method 
which returns a composed predicate that represents 
a short-circuiting logical OR of given predicate and another predicate.

When evaluating the composed predicate, 
if first predicate is true, then the other predicate is not evaluated.

Any exceptions thrown during evaluation of either 
predicate are relayed to the caller; if evaluation 
of first predicate throws an exception, 
the other predicate will not be evaluated.
